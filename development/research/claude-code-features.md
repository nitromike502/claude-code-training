# Claude Code Features Research

**Purpose:** Analysis of official Claude Code documentation vs. initial assumptions. Corrections and discoveries that impact training content.

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-28 (Session 1 Development)

## Key Documentation Sources Analyzed

1. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart.md
2. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows.md
3. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings.md
4. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/terminal-config.md
5. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference.md
6. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/interactive-mode.md

## Major Corrections to Initial Assumptions

### Getting Started Process
- **Reality:** Simply type `claude` in project folder - no complex initialization required
- **Previous Assumption:** Needed `claude code init` command or complex setup
- **Impact:** Simplified all getting-started instructions for non-technical users

### Available Slash Commands
- **Documented Commands:** `/help`, `/config`, `/clear`, `/terminal-setup`
- **Previous Speculation:** Had assumed commands like `/docs`, `/status`, `/find` existed
- **Training Update:** Focused only on actually available commands

### Interactive Mode Navigation
- **Key Features:** Arrow keys for command history, `\` + Enter for multiline
- **Terminal Optimization:** `/terminal-setup` command configures line breaks automatically
- **Screen Management:** Ctrl+L clears screen while preserving conversation history

## Actual Claude Code Capabilities

### Core Features
- **Natural Language Processing:** Understands context from entire project codebase
- **Project Analysis:** Provides architecture overviews and component relationships
- **Documentation Generation:** Helps create user guides and technical specifications
- **Cross-Language Support:** Works with full-stack applications (Laravel + Vue.js confirmed)

### CLI Functionality
- **Basic Usage:** `claude` starts interactive mode
- **Quick Queries:** `claude -p "question"` for direct questions
- **Conversation Continuation:** `claude -c` to continue last session
- **Model Selection:** `claude --model sonnet` to choose specific model

### Interactive Mode Features
- **Command History:** Up/Down arrows to navigate previous commands
- **Multiline Input:** Multiple methods for entering longer text
- **Memory:** Remembers conversation context within sessions
- **Edit Previous:** Double-press Escape to modify previous message

## Workflow Patterns for Non-Technical Users

### Project Understanding
- High-level codebase overviews
- Component architecture explanation
- Data model and relationship analysis
- Business impact assessment of technical changes

### Documentation Support
- Identifying areas lacking documentation
- Generating consistent, clear documentation
- Maintaining documentation standards
- Translating technical concepts to business language

### Communication Assistance
- Summarizing code changes for stakeholders
- Creating PR descriptions with context
- Explaining technical decisions in business terms
- Bridging technical and non-technical team communication

## Training Environment Validation

### Demo Project Compatibility
- **Confirmed:** Laravel + Vue.js e-commerce project works well
- **Full-Stack Understanding:** Claude comprehends backend API and frontend component relationships
- **Business Context:** E-commerce features are relatable to non-technical audiences

### Command Verification Needed
- [ ] Test all documented slash commands in training environment
- [ ] Verify interactive mode navigation works as described
- [ ] Confirm conversation memory behavior across sessions
- [ ] Validate multiline input methods

## Feature Gaps Identified

### Not Available (vs. Initial Assumptions)
- Dedicated document structure planning commands
- Automatic reference management tools  
- Built-in documentation update tracking
- Specific non-technical user modes

### Workarounds for Training
- Use natural language questions for document planning
- Manual reference management through conversation
- Ask Claude to check documentation currency
- Frame all features through non-technical lens
