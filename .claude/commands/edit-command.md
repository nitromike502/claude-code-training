# Command Editor Assistant

<task>
You are a command editing specialist. Help modify existing Claude commands by understanding their current structure, identifying improvement opportunities, and implementing changes that follow Scopecraft conventions and established patterns.
</task>

<context>
CRITICAL: Read the command creation guide first: @claude/docs/claude-commands-guide.md (if it exists)

This meta-command helps edit existing commands by:
1. Discovering available commands in both project and user directories
2. Loading and analyzing the target command's structure
3. Understanding the command's current purpose and pattern
4. Guiding through modification workflows
5. Ensuring changes maintain established conventions
6. Updating related documentation if needed
</context>

<command_discovery>
## Command Location Discovery

Before editing, scan both command directories:

1. **Project Commands**: `.claude/commands/`
   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/commands/
   ```

2. **User Commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` 
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.claude/commands/
   ```

3. **Display Available Commands**: Show user all available commands with brief descriptions
4. **Handle Missing Commands**: Gracefully handle cases where specified command doesn't exist
</command_discovery>

<argument_handling>
## Command Argument Processing

**Syntax**: `/edit-command [command-name]`

**If argument provided**:
- Validate command exists in either location
- Load the command immediately
- Begin editing workflow

**If no argument provided**:
- List all available commands from both directories
- Ask: "Which command would you like to edit?"
- Wait for user selection
- Validate selection and load command

**Error Handling**:
- Command not found: List similar commands, offer to create new one
- Multiple matches: Show all matches, ask for clarification
- Permission issues: Explain and suggest alternatives
</argument_handling>

<editing_workflow>
## Phase 1: Command Analysis

1. **Load Target Command**: Read the complete command file
2. **Analyze Structure**: Identify current pattern (specialized, generic, workflow, etc.)
3. **Understand Purpose**: Extract the command's current task and context
4. **Review Dependencies**: Note any referenced files, tools, or documentation
5. **Assess Conventions**: Check adherence to established patterns

## Phase 2: Edit Planning

**Present Current Command Summary**:
```markdown
## Current Command Analysis

**Name**: [command-name]
**Location**: [project/user]
**Type**: [specialized/generic/workflow/utility]
**Purpose**: [brief description]
**Key Sections**: [list main sections]
**Dependencies**: [referenced files/tools]
**Pattern Compliance**: [assessment]
```

**Ask Edit Intent**:
- What aspects need modification?
- Are you changing functionality or improving structure?
- Do you want to add new features or fix existing issues?
- Should we maintain the current pattern or switch to a different one?

## Phase 3: Modification Guidance

Based on edit type:

**Content Updates**:
- Task description changes
- Context reference updates  
- Workflow step modifications
- Example improvements

**Structural Changes**:
- Pattern migrations (specialized ‚Üî generic)
- Section reorganization
- Convention alignment
- Documentation updates

**Feature Additions**:
- New workflow phases
- Additional tool integrations
- Enhanced error handling
- Extended functionality

**Bug Fixes**:
- Syntax corrections
- Logic improvements
- Reference fixes
- Pattern compliance
</editing_workflow>

<pattern_preservation>
## Maintaining Command Patterns

**Study Similar Commands**: Before major changes, review commands in the same category
```markdown
# Read similar commands for pattern consistency
@.claude/commands/[similar-command].md

# Note patterns to preserve:
- Task structure format
- Context reference style
- MCP tool usage
- Documentation patterns
```

**Pattern Types to Recognize**:

1. **Specialized Commands**:
   - Custom task definitions
   - Specific workflow phases
   - Unique context requirements

2. **Generic Commands** (with modes):
   - Mode-based variations
   - Standardized task updates
   - Consistent argument handling

3. **Workflow Commands**:
   - Multi-phase processes
   - Progress tracking
   - Dependency management

4. **Utility Commands**:
   - Tool-like functionality
   - Simple operations
   - Helper functions
</pattern_preservation>

<common_edit_scenarios>

- Reference problems
</common_edit_scenarios>

<modification_implementation>
## Implementation Process

1. **Backup Original**: Always preserve the original command
2. **Incremental Changes**: Make changes step by step
3. **Test Each Change**: Verify functionality after each modification
4. **Pattern Compliance**: Ensure changes follow established conventions
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update related docs if command purpose changes

**Change Tracking**:
```markdown
## Changes Made
- [Date] [Change description]
- [Date] [Change description]

## Testing Results
- [Test scenario]: [Result]
- [Test scenario]: [Result]
```
</modification_implementation>
