# Session 3: Creating Great Documentation with `.md` Files

**Length:** 20 minutes  
**Goal:** Attendees will be able to use the `@docu` sub-agent to generate project documentation and understand the basics of Markdown (`.md`) for formatting.  
**Core Concepts:** Sub-Agents (@docu), Using Markdown  

## Agenda

### 1. (2 min) Recap & Goal
"We briefly met `@docu`, the librarian. Today we'll put it to work creating clean, easy-to-read documentation."

Documentation is crucial for:
- Onboarding new team members
- Understanding complex features  
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Creating user guides and API references

### 2. (5 min) What is a `.md` (Markdown) File?

#### Simple Explanation
Explain Markdown as "a way to write for the web without writing code." It's just a text file with a few simple symbols.

#### Quick Comparison Table
| You Type | You Get |
|----------|---------|
| `# Heading` | # Big heading |
| `## Subheading` | ## Smaller heading |
| `**bold text**` | **bold text** |
| `*italic text*` | *italic text* |
| `- item` | â€¢ Bullet point |
| `1. item` | 1. Numbered list |
| `` `code` `` | `highlighted code` |

#### Why Markdown Matters
- Used everywhere: GitHub, Confluence, Jira, Slack, Discord
- Easy to read even in plain text
- Converts beautifully to HTML, PDF, or formatted documents
- Version control friendly (unlike Word docs)

### 3. (10 min) Live Demo: Generating Documentation

#### Example 1: Single Component Documentation
```bash
# Document the shopping cart component
claude-code @docu resources/js/components/ShoppingCart.vue > shopping-cart-guide.md
```

**Explain the `>` symbol:** "This tells the computer to save the output into a new file called `shopping-cart-guide.md`."

#### Sample Output Preview
```markdown
# Shopping Cart Component Guide

## Overview
The ShoppingCart component manages customer's selected items before checkout.

## Features
- **Add/Remove Items**: Customers can modify quantities or remove products
- **Price Calculation**: Automatically updates totals including tax and shipping  
- **Persistence**: Cart contents saved between browser sessions
- **Validation**: Checks inventory before allowing checkout

## User Actions
1. View cart contents with product images and details
2. Modify item quantities using +/- buttons  
3. Remove items with delete button
4. Apply discount codes
5. Proceed to checkout when ready

## Technical Details
- Uses Vue.js reactivity for state management
- Connects to Laravel API endpoints for cart operations
- Implements optimistic updates for better user experience
```

#### Example 2: API Documentation
```bash
# Document all product-related API endpoints
claude-code @docu routes/api.php --filter="product" --style=api-reference > product-api-docs.md
```

#### Example 3: Feature Overview
```bash
# Document the entire checkout process (multiple files)
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php backend/src/views/Checkout.vue --style=feature-overview > checkout-process.md
```

#### Different Documentation Styles Available
- `--style=user-guide` - For end users and customers
- `--style=api-reference` - For developers integrating with APIs  
- `--style=feature-overview` - For product managers and stakeholders
- `--style=troubleshooting` - For support teams and QA

### 4. (3 min) Practical Applications & Workflows

#### For Technical Writers
```bash
# Weekly workflow: Document new features
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/NewFeatureController.php --style=user-guide > new-feature-guide.md

# Edit the generated file to add screenshots, examples, and polish
# Copy content to Confluence or company documentation system
```

#### For Project Managers
```bash
# Quarterly review: Document major system components  
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/ --style=feature-overview > system-overview-q1.md

# Use for stakeholder presentations and team planning
```

#### For QA Teams
```bash
# Test planning: Understand feature functionality
claude-code @docu backend/src/views/PaymentForm.vue --style=troubleshooting > payment-testing-guide.md

# Reference for writing test cases and bug reports
```

## Advanced Documentation Techniques

### Combining Multiple Sources
```bash
# Document complete user registration flow
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php backend/src/views/Register.vue app/Models/User.php --style=user-guide > complete-registration-guide.md
```

### Adding Custom Context
```bash
# Include business context in technical documentation
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php --context="This handles our B2B wholesale ordering system" --style=feature-overview > wholesale-orders.md
```

### Filtering for Specific Functions
```bash
# Document only public methods/functions
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php --filter="public" > product-api.md
```

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Project Documentation Set
```bash
# User-facing documentation
claude-code @docu resources/js/components/ProductListing.vue --style=user-guide > product-browsing-guide.md
claude-code @docu backend/src/views/Checkout.vue --style=user-guide > checkout-guide.md

# Developer documentation  
claude-code @docu routes/api.php --style=api-reference > api-reference.md
claude-code @docu app/Models/ --style=technical > database-models.md

# Business documentation
claude-code @docu app/Http/Controllers/ --style=feature-overview > business-features.md
```

## Editing and Sharing Generated Documentation

### After Generation - Your Turn!
1. **Open the `.md` file** in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, even Notepad)
2. **Add your insights:** Screenshots, examples, business context  
3. **Polish the language:** Make it match your company's tone
4. **Add real examples:** Replace placeholder data with actual examples

### Sharing Options
- **Copy-paste into Confluence:** Most formatting will be preserved
- **Upload to Sharepoint:** Many systems support Markdown preview
- **Email as attachment:** Readable even in plain text
- **Convert to PDF:** Use tools like Pandoc or online converters
- **Commit to Git:** Version control your documentation alongside code

## Q&A Preparation

**"Can I edit the `.md` file afterwards?"**  
Answer: Yes! It's just a text file. You own it completely. Think of Claude's output as a first draft that you can improve and customize.

**"How do I share this with my team?"**  
Answer: You can copy-paste the content into Confluence, email, or Jira tickets. Most of the formatting will be preserved automatically.

**"What if I don't like the generated documentation?"**  
Answer: Try different styles (`--style=user-guide` vs `--style=technical`) or add context (`--context="Our mobile app feature"`). You can also regenerate with more specific instructions.

**"Can it document our complex business rules?"**  
Answer: Yes! Claude understands business logic in your Laravel controllers and can explain complex workflows, validation rules, and business processes.
