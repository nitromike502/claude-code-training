## Template Usage Instructions

### When to Create Session Notes
- **Start of development:** Create file from template when beginning work on a session
- **During development:** Update sections as you work through content creation
- **After completion:** Fill in final insights and lessons learned
- **Post-training:** Add user feedback and validation results

### How to Adapt Template
- **Remove sections** not relevant to specific session type
- **Add sections** for session-specific needs (e.g., technical setup, special demos)
- **Modify role sections** based on target audience for that session
- **Customize metrics** based on session-specific success criteria
