# Content Standards & Guidelines

**Purpose:** Writing, presentation, and accessibility standards for Claude Code training materials.

## Writing Standards

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Zero Technical Background Assumed** - Explain all concepts from first principles
- **Plain English Preference** - Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical terminology
- **Define When Necessary** - If technical terms are unavoidable, provide clear definitions
- **Progressive Complexity** - Start with simple concepts, build understanding gradually

### Language Guidelines
- **Active Voice** - "Claude helps you understand" vs "Understanding is facilitated by Claude"
- **Second Person** - Address learners directly as "you" 
- **Present Tense** - "Claude analyzes your project" vs "Claude will analyze"
- **Concrete Examples** - Every feature needs a specific, realistic use case

### Tone & Voice
- **Encouraging** - Build confidence, avoid intimidation
- **Professional but Approachable** - Workplace appropriate, not overly casual
- **Reassuring** - Address fears and concerns directly
- **Practical** - Focus on immediate applicability and business value

## Content Structure Standards

### Session Organization
- **Clear Learning Objectives** - State what attendees will know/be able to do
- **Time Allocations** - Realistic timing with buffers for questions
- **Progressive Building** - Each section builds on previous concepts
- **Summary Reinforcement** - Key takeaways at session end

### Example Requirements
- **Business Context** - Use scenarios relevant to their work environment
- **Specific Questions** - Show exact questions they would ask, not abstract concepts
- **Expected Outcomes** - Demonstrate what Claude Code would respond
- **Role Relevance** - Connect examples to job functions

### Demo Standards
- **Real Projects** - Use actual codebases, not toy examples
- **Natural Interaction** - Show conversational queries, not command syntax
- **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple, reveal more sophisticated capabilities
- **Business Value** - Connect technical features to business outcomes

## Accessibility Standards

### Visual Design (for presentations)
- **High Contrast** - Readable in various lighting conditions
- **Large Fonts** - Minimum 24pt for presentations
- **Simple Layouts** - Avoid cluttered slides or dense text blocks
- **Consistent Formatting** - Standard styles for headings, bullets, examples

### Content Accessibility
- **Multiple Learning Styles** - Combine explanations, examples, and demonstrations
- **Repetition of Key Concepts** - Reinforce important points throughout sessions
- **Various Engagement Methods** - Questions, discussions, hands-on practice
- **Cultural Sensitivity** - Use inclusive examples and avoid assumptions

## Quality Assurance Process

### Content Review Checklist
- [ ] All technical claims verified against current Claude Code documentation
- [ ] Examples tested in actual Claude Code environment
- [ ] Language reviewed for accessibility and clarity
- [ ] Timing validated with full run-through including demos
- [ ] Role-specific value propositions clearly articulated

### User Testing Protocol
- [ ] Test with representatives from each target role (PM, QA, Tech Writer)
- [ ] Measure comprehension through follow-up questions
- [ ] Gather feedback on language clarity and accessibility
- [ ] Assess confidence levels before and after training
- [ ] Track adoption rates in following weeks

## Presentation Guidelines

### Delivery Standards
- **Interactive Approach** - Encourage questions throughout, not just at end
- **Pause for Processing** - Allow time for concept absorption
- **Check Understanding** - Ask clarifying questions, watch for confusion
- **Adapt Pace** - Slow down or speed up based on audience engagement

### Demo Best Practices
- **Test Environment** - Verify all examples work before presentation
- **Backup Plans** - Have alternative examples if technology fails
- **Clear Narration** - Explain what you're doing and why
- **Audience Participation** - Invite questions and suggestions during demo

### Time Management
- **Buffer Time** - Build in 15-20% extra time for questions and discussion
- **Checkpoint Timing** - Track progress against planned schedule
- **Priority Content** - Identify core vs. optional content for time adjustments
- **Question Handling** - Address questions immediately vs. parking for later

## Content Maintenance

### Update Protocols
- **Feature Verification** - Check Claude Code capabilities before each training session
- **Example Currency** - Ensure demo projects and examples remain current
- **Feedback Integration** - Incorporate learnings from actual training sessions
- **Documentation Updates** - Revise content when Claude Code features change

### Version Control
- **Change Documentation** - Track what was modified and why
- **Date Stamps** - Include last update dates on all training materials
- **Revision History** - Maintain record of significant content changes
- **Approval Process** - Review changes with subject matter experts

## Success Metrics

### Session Effectiveness
- **Engagement Indicators** - Questions asked, participation level, follow-up interest
- **Comprehension Assessment** - Ability to explain Claude Code's purpose after training
- **Confidence Measures** - Willingness to try examples independently
- **Practical Application** - Use of Claude Code on real projects within one week

### Content Quality Indicators
- **Clarity Feedback** - Participant reports that explanations were understandable
- **Relevance Assessment** - Examples connected to their actual work needs
- **Accessibility Confirmation** - No technical background assumptions created barriers
- **Business Value Recognition** - Clear connection between features and job benefits
