# Session 1: What is Claude Code & Why Should I Use It?

**Length:** 15 minutes  
**Goal:** Attendees will understand the core purpose of Claude Code and identify at least two ways it can help them in their specific role.  
**Core Concepts:** Overview, Core Philosophy  

## Agenda

### 1. (2 min) Introduction: The "Black Box" Problem
Start by acknowledging the common challenge: for non-developers, a project's codebase can feel like an intimidating, inaccessible "black box."

### 2. (5 min) What is Claude Code? Your Personal Project Translator
- Explain Claude Code not as a "coding" tool, but as an **AI assistant that has read and understood the entire project.**
- **Analogy:** It's like having a friendly junior developer sitting next to you, ready to answer questions, summarize complex parts, and write notes for you.

### 3. (6 min) Three Things You Can Do *Today* (A Teaser)

#### Ask Questions in Plain English
**Example:** `@claude what does the ProductController do in this e-commerce site?`
- Show how you can ask about specific parts of a Laravel Vue.js e-commerce application
- Demonstrate asking about customer authentication, product management, or shopping cart functionality

#### Generate Summaries  
**Example:** `@claude summarize the shopping cart functionality in the Vue.js components`
- Show how Claude can explain complex frontend-backend interactions in simple terms
- Perfect for when developers mention file changes and you need context

#### Find Where Things Happen
**Example:** `@claude where is the customer registration handled?`
- Demonstrate finding specific functionality across both Laravel backend (`/app/Http/Controllers/Auth`) and Vue.js frontend (`/resources/js/components/`)
- Show how it can locate error handling, validation logic, or API endpoints

### 4. (2 min) Wrap-up & What's Next
Recap the key benefit: Claude Code makes the project transparent and accessible to everyone. Tease the next session where they'll connect it to their own projects.

## Role-Specific Use Cases

### Project Manager
- **Question:** "Where can I find the product inventory management code?"
- **Benefit:** Understanding technical scope without interrupting developers
- **Example:** Getting insights into database schema, API endpoints, and business logic

### QA Tester  
- **Question:** "Show me where error messages for invalid payment info are generated"
- **Benefit:** Writing better bug reports with exact file locations and context
- **Example:** Finding validation logic in both Laravel controllers and Vue.js components

### Technical Writer
- **Question:** "Explain the user registration flow for documentation" 
- **Benefit:** Understanding complex workflows to create accurate user guides
- **Example:** Documenting multi-step processes that span frontend and backend

## Q&A Preparation

**"Is this going to change my files?"**  
Answer: Not unless you explicitly ask it to and confirm. Claude Code is primarily for reading and understanding, not modifying.

**"Is it watching me work?"**  
Answer: No, it's a tool you actively use. It only analyzes the code when you ask it to.

**"Will this work with our Laravel projects?"**  
Answer: Yes! Claude Code works excellently with Laravel backend code, Vue.js frontend components, and full-stack applications.

**"Can it handle Vue.js components and PHP controllers equally well?"**  
Answer: Absolutely. Claude Code understands the relationships between your Laravel API endpoints and Vue.js components that consume them.

**"What about database migrations and frontend state management?"**  
Answer: Claude Code can explain database schema changes, migration files, Vuex/Pinia state management, and how data flows through your entire application stack.

## Live Demo Setup

### Recommended Project: Laravel Vue.js E-commerce
- **Repository:** `thecodeholic/laravel-vue-ecommerce` 
- **Why this project:** Educational focus with step-by-step tutorials and real-world e-commerce features
- **Key files to showcase:**
  - `/app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php` - Backend product management
  - `/resources/js/components/Checkout.vue` - Frontend checkout flow  
  - `/database/migrations/` - Database structure
  - `/routes/api.php` - API endpoints
  - `/resources/js/store/` - Vue.js state management

### Sample Claude Code Commands for Demo
1. `@claude what is the purpose of the ProductController?`
2. `@claude summarize how the shopping cart works`
3. `@claude where is user authentication handled?`
4. `@claude explain the checkout process`
5. `@claude what database tables are used for orders?`

## Key Takeaways
- Claude Code transforms intimidating codebases into accessible information
- Works seamlessly with modern full-stack applications (Laravel + Vue.js)
- Provides instant context without needing to interrupt developers
- Empowers non-technical team members to understand and contribute to technical discussions
