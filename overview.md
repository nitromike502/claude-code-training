# Claude Code Lunch & Learn Training Materials

This repository contains a comprehensive 5-session training series designed to onboard non-technical team members to Claude Code. The training materials bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams by making complex codebases accessible to everyone.

## Overall Goal
To empower non-technical staff to confidently use Claude Code for project analysis, documentation, and communication, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams.

## Training Series Structure

The training is organized as individual 15-20 minute sessions, each with specific learning objectives:

### Session Documents
- **[Session 1](./sessions/session-1.md)**: What is Claude Code & Why Should I Use It?
- **[Session 2](./sessions/session-2.md)**: Pointing Claude at Your Project  
- **[Session 3](./sessions/session-3.md)**: Creating Great Documentation with `.md` Files
- **[Session 4](./sessions/session-4.md)**: The Next Level: What are MCP Servers?
- **[Session 5](./sessions/session-5.md)**: Meet the Sub-Agents (Claude Code's "Modes")

## Example Project
The training materials use a **Laravel Vue.js E-commerce application** as the primary example throughout all sessions. This provides:

- **Relatable context**: E-commerce features everyone understands (shopping cart, checkout, user accounts)
- **Full-stack complexity**: Demonstrates Claude Code's ability to work with both backend (Laravel/PHP) and frontend (Vue.js/JavaScript) code
- **Real-world scenarios**: Practical examples for Project Managers, QA Testers, Technical Writers, and other non-technical roles

### Recommended Example Repository
- **Primary**: `thecodeholic/laravel-vue-ecommerce` - Full-stack Laravel + Vue.js e-commerce platform with educational focus
- **Secondary**: `jasco-b/laravel-vue-todo` - Simple todo app for basic demonstrations

## Target Audience

### Primary Roles
- **Project Managers**: Understanding technical scope, timeline planning, stakeholder communication
- **QA Testers**: Writing better bug reports, understanding system workflows, test planning  
- **Technical Writers**: Creating user documentation, API references, feature guides
- **Product Managers**: Understanding business logic implementation, feature impact analysis

### Key Learning Outcomes
By completing this training series, participants will be able to:

1. **Ask intelligent questions** about any codebase using plain English
2. **Generate professional documentation** from existing code  
3. **Locate specific functionality** across complex full-stack applications
4. **Understand system workflows** without interrupting developers
5. **Contribute meaningfully** to technical discussions and planning

## Session Delivery Notes

Each session document includes:
- ✅ **Presenter agenda** with specific timing
- ✅ **Live demo instructions** with actual commands
- ✅ **Q&A preparation** with common questions and answers  
- ✅ **Role-specific examples** tailored to different job functions
- ✅ **Real-world scenarios** using the Laravel Vue.js e-commerce project

## Getting Started

1. **For Presenters**: Review each session document before delivery
2. **For Setup**: Clone the recommended example project for live demonstrations
3. **For Participants**: No preparation needed - sessions build progressively from basics

## Training Philosophy

This curriculum follows these principles:
- **Practical over theoretical**: Every concept demonstrated with real examples
- **Role-specific relevance**: Examples tailored to common non-technical use cases  
- **Progressive complexity**: Each session builds on the previous one
- **Hands-on practice**: Participants encouraged to try commands during sessions
- **Real-world context**: Using actual open-source projects rather than toy examples
