<setup_workflow>
## Phase 1: Environment Assessment & Preparation

1. **System Check**: Verify DDEV installation and Docker availability
2. **Project Discovery**: Locate and analyze the demo project structure
3. **Dependency Verification**: Ensure all required components are available
4. **Configuration Review**: Check existing setup and identify requirements

## Phase 2: Demo Project Initialization

### **DDEV Container Setup**
- Navigate to `examples/laravel-vue-ecommerce/` directory
- Initialize DDEV configuration if not already present
- Start DDEV containers with `ddev start`
- Verify container health and networking

### **Laravel Backend Configuration**
- Install PHP dependencies with `ddev composer install`
- Configure environment variables and database connections
- Run database migrations with `ddev exec "php artisan migrate:fresh --seed"`
- Verify API endpoints are responding correctly

### **Vue.js Frontend Setup**
- Install Node.js dependencies with `ddev exec npm install`
- Configure Vite development server settings
- Start development servers with `ddev start-dev`
- Verify frontend compilation and hot reload functionality

## Phase 3: Data & Content Preparation

### **Sample Data Seeding**
- Execute database seeders to populate demo content
- Verify product catalog with realistic e-commerce data
- Ensure user accounts are created (admin@example.com / admin123)
- Test order processing and customer management features

### **Demonstration Scenarios**
- Prepare specific use cases for each training session
- Create realistic business scenarios for role-specific examples
- Set up common workflow demonstrations
- Configure troubleshooting scenarios for Q&A sessions

## Phase 4: Access & Connectivity Verification

### **URL Accessibility**
- **Frontend**: Verify `http://laravel-vue-ecommerce.ddev.site` responds
- **Admin Panel**: Confirm `http://laravel-vue-ecommerce.ddev.site:3000` loads
- **API Endpoints**: Test backend API functionality
- **Database Access**: Verify database connectivity and data integrity

### **Performance Optimization**
- Clear application caches and optimize for presentation
- Ensure fast loading times for live demonstrations
- Pre-warm commonly accessed features
- Verify responsive design for various screen sizes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Container Problems**
- **Issue**: DDEV containers won't start
- **Solution**: Check Docker status, restart Docker service, clear DDEV cache
- **Backup**: Have screenshots/video of working environment

### **Database Connection Issues**
- **Issue**: Laravel can't connect to database
- **Solution**: Verify DDEV database credentials, restart containers
- **Backup**: Use SQLite fallback configuration if needed

### **Frontend Build Problems**
- **Issue**: Vite development server fails to start
- **Solution**: Clear node_modules, reinstall dependencies, check port conflicts
- **Backup**: Serve pre-built static files as fallback

### **Network Access Issues**
- **Issue**: URLs not accessible from presentation machine
- **Solution**: Check DDEV hostname configuration, verify firewall settings
- **Backup**: Use localhost URLs or prepared screenshots

### **Performance Degradation**
- **Issue**: Slow loading during live demonstration
- **Solution**: Pre-warm caches, close unnecessary applications, optimize Docker resources
- **Backup**: Have key screenshots ready to show if needed

## Setup Commands During Preparation

**Full setup**: "Run complete demo setup" or "Setup everything"
**Quick check**: "Verify demo environment" or "Check if ready"
**Specific component**: "Setup [laravel|vue|database]" 
**Session prep**: "Prepare for session [number]"
**Troubleshoot**: "Fix demo issues" or "Diagnose problems"
**Reset environment**: "Reset demo data" or "Fresh setup"

## Verification Commands

**Check performance**: "Performance check" or "Optimize for demo"
**Validate data**: "Check demo data" or "Verify sample content"
**Session readiness**: "Ready for session [number]?"
</interactive_commands>

## Usage Instructions

Run `/setup-demo` and I will:

1. **Assess Environment**: Check system requirements and current state
2. **Initialize Infrastructure**: Start DDEV containers and configure services
3. **Prepare Applications**: Setup Laravel backend and Vue.js frontend
4. **Seed Demonstration Data**: Populate database with realistic content
5. **Verify Readiness**: Test all components and confirm presentation-ready state
6. **Provide Status Report**: Summary of setup results and any issues resolved

**Example Workflow**:
- You: `/setup-demo`
- Me: *[Checks DDEV status, starts containers, configures applications]*
- Me: *[Reports: "Demo environment ready! All services running, URLs accessible"]*
- You: "Prepare for session 3"
- Me: *[Configures specific documentation examples and markdown editing setup]*
- You: "Quick check before presentation"
- Me: *[Verifies all components and provides go/no-go status]*

**Session-Specific Preparation**:
- You: `/setup-demo` → "Which session are you presenting? (1-5)"
- You: "Session 4" → *[Configures MCP server demonstrations and analysis examples]*

The setup ensures your training presentations run smoothly with a fully functional demonstration environment that showcases Claude Code capabilities effectively for non-technical audiences.
