- [ ] **Next Steps Clarity** - Do they know how to get started on their own projects?
- [ ] **Barrier Identification** - What would prevent them from using this tool?

## Follow-Up Validation

### Short-Term Tracking (1 Week)
- [ ] **Usage Attempts** - Did they try Claude Code on their own projects?
- [ ] **Success/Failure Points** - What worked well or caused problems?
- [ ] **Question Patterns** - What types of questions did they ask Claude?
- [ ] **Value Realization** - Did they get useful insights from the tool?
- [ ] **Barrier Encounters** - What prevented them from getting value?

### Medium-Term Assessment (1 Month)
- [ ] **Adoption Patterns** - Regular use vs. one-time trial
- [ ] **Integration Success** - How Claude Code fits into their workflow
- [ ] **Team Impact** - Has usage reduced developer interruptions?
- [ ] **Business Value** - Concrete examples of time saved or better decisions
- [ ] **Advocacy Behavior** - Are they recommending Claude Code to colleagues?

## Training Environment Checklist
