## Phase 1: Change Discovery & Impact Analysis

### **Recent Changes Identification**
1. **Git History Review**: Analyze recent commits to understand what has changed
2. **File Modification Tracking**: Identify which components have been updated
3. **Feature Impact Assessment**: Determine how changes affect existing documentation
4. **Scope Definition**: Define what documentation needs updating based on changes

### **Change Analysis Commands**
- Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`
- Check modified files: `git diff --name-only HEAD~5..HEAD`
- Analyze specific changes: `git show [commit-hash]`
- Identify documentation gaps: Compare code changes with existing docs

## Phase 2: Core Documentation Updates

### **CLAUDE.md Maintenance**
- **Reference Document Updates**: Ensure all @-referenced files are current and accessible
- **Workflow Accuracy**: Verify described processes match current implementation
- **Command Verification**: Test that all referenced commands still work
- **Context Relevance**: Update project context to reflect recent changes

### **README.md Strategy**
- **Avoid Main README Updates**: Focus on maintaining CLAUDE.md as the primary guidance
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure README doesn't conflict with CLAUDE.md
- **Redirect Strategy**: Keep README minimal, directing users to CLAUDE.md

## Phase 3: Component Documentation Review

### **Architectural Decision Updates**
- **Design Decision Documentation**: Update ADRs or design docs for architectural changes
- **Pattern Documentation**: Ensure coding patterns and conventions are current
- **Integration Guidelines**: Update integration points and dependencies
- **Configuration Changes**: Document new environment or setup requirements

### **Development Pattern Updates**
- **Workflow Changes**: Update development workflows if processes have changed
- **Tool Integration**: Document new tools or changed tool configurations
- **Testing Procedures**: Update testing documentation for new test patterns
- **Deployment Processes**: Ensure deployment docs reflect current procedures

## Phase 4: Training Materials Synchronization

### **Session Content Updates**
- **Feature Currency**: Ensure training sessions reflect current Claude Code features
- **Example Accuracy**: Verify all examples and commands in training materials work
- **Demo Project Alignment**: Update training references to match demo project state
- **Prerequisite Updates**: Ensure setup requirements are current

### **Training Infrastructure Documentation**
- **Setup Procedures**: Update setup-demo and related processes
- **Presentation Tools**: Document any changes to presentation infrastructure
- **Environment Requirements**: Update system and software requirements
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Add new common issues and solutions

## Phase 5: Inline Documentation Updates

### **Code Documentation Review**
- **Function Comments**: Update comments that may be outdated by recent changes
- **Configuration Documentation**: Update config file comments and examples
- **API Documentation**: Ensure API docs match current implementation
- **Command Documentation**: Update command help text and examples

### **Configuration and Setup Documentation**
- **Environment Variables**: Document new or changed environment variables
- **Dependencies**: Update dependency lists and version requirements
- **Installation Instructions**: Verify setup steps are current and complete
- **Development Environment**: Update development setup documentation

## Phase 6: Documentation Verification & Quality Assurance

### **Accuracy Verification**
- **Code Example Testing**: Test all code examples in documentation
- **Command Verification**: Verify all commands and procedures actually work
- **Link Validation**: Check that all internal and external links are working
- **Version Currency**: Ensure version numbers and feature references are current

### **Clarity and Completeness Review**
- **New Developer Perspective**: Review docs from a fresh developer's viewpoint
- **Missing Information**: Identify and fill gaps in documentation coverage
- **Outdated Information**: Remove or update information that's no longer relevant
- **Cross-Reference Consistency**: Ensure consistent information across all documents

## Documentation Update Priorities

### **High Priority - Critical for Project Function**
1. **CLAUDE.md Accuracy**: Core project guidance must be current
2. **Setup Documentation**: Installation and environment setup must work
3. **Training Session Content**: Session materials must reflect current features
4. **Command Documentation**: All commands must work as documented

### **Medium Priority - Important for Developer Experience**
1. **Development Patterns**: Coding standards and patterns should be current
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Design decisions should be documented
3. **Configuration Documentation**: Setup requirements should be complete
4. **API Documentation**: Current API behavior should be documented

### **Lower Priority - Enhances Long-term Maintainability**
1. **Inline Code Comments**: Helpful but not blocking
2. **Historical Documentation**: Legacy information can be updated gradually
3. **Detailed Examples**: Additional examples enhance but don't block
4. **Cross-reference Optimization**: Nice-to-have consistency improvements
</priority_areas>

## Usage Instructions

Run `/docs` and I will:

1. **Analyze Recent Changes**: Review git history to understand what has changed
2. **Update Core Documentation**: Ensure CLAUDE.md and key docs reflect current state
3. **Review Component Documentation**: Update architecture, patterns, and integration docs
4. **Synchronize Training Materials**: Ensure training content is current and accurate
5. **Update Inline Documentation**: Refresh code comments and configuration documentation
6. **Verify Documentation Accuracy**: Test examples, commands, and links for correctness
7. **Provide Update Summary**: Report what was updated and any issues found

**Example Workflow**:
- You: `/docs`
- Me: *[Reviews recent commits, identifies documentation that needs updating]*
- Me: *[Updates CLAUDE.md, training sessions, and component docs as needed]*
- Me: *[Tests examples and commands, verifies links and references]*
- Me: *[Provides summary of updates made and any issues resolved]*

**Focused Updates**:
- You: `/docs` â†’ "Focus on training materials"
- Me: *[Reviews and updates only training session content and demo documentation]*
- You: `/docs` â†’ "Update for recent changes"
- Me: *[Analyzes recent commits and updates only affected documentation]*

The documentation update process ensures that all project documentation remains current, accurate, and helpful for both current team members and future developers working on the Claude Code training materials.
